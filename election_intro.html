<p>Since the election, numerous blog posts as well as popular election data sites such as Fivethirtyeight and the Upshot looked through the geographic patterns of the election results and how well it correlated local demographics such as race, education and income. One striking result found was that the 2016 presidential election result was somewhat less correlated to the prior election compared to the usual for previous pairs (2012 vs 2008, 2008 vs 2004). Nationally, places where Trump did better than Romney tend to be less well-educated while, while the reverse was true for places Trump did worse than Romney. Did this election partially reflect another political axis other the usual left-right axis?</p>

<p>To explore local voting patterns, I looked at precinct-level data of Massachusetts, the most detailed geography available (counties are usually used). Election precincts vary in size, but usually contain 750-3,000 people, roughly the size of a town neighborhood. The lines precinct lines are usually drawn to include places that are are well-connected. One benefit over looking at town or city-level results is that municipalities vary much more in size; a city the size of Boston (about 690,000 people) will have large cultural differences between neighborhoods while a small town of 2,000 is relatively homogeneous. Besides Massachusetts being my state of residence, it uses ballot referenda more frequently than most Northeastern states. Ballot referenda help gauge which issues don't fit the usual left-right spectrum, and what fit the change to/against Trump the most. With these additional voting axis (say for example especially left on economic questions but not social or vica versa), one can classify the state by which places are particularly left on some issues more than other and see if there's any interesting demographic correlations. </p>

<p>A small map of the cluster groups is shown above; I also made a </a><a href="kmeans_map.html">more detailed</a>, zoomable map. Someone familiar with Massachusetts geography would find many patterns here. Here's how I interperted them:</p>

<ol>
<li>Red: Urban liberal working-class, some mostly white, some diverse; often old mill towns</li>
<li>Yellow: Liberal rural, mostly white, somewhat similar to light blue but more moderate</li>
<li>Blue: Poor urban minority areas</li>
<li>Green: Rural and outer suburb working-class; moderate to conservative</li>
<li>Purple: Middle-class suburban; similar green but wealthier</li>
<li>Light blue: very liberal areas on both social and economic issues that are or vote like a college town, went strongly for Bernie Sanders</li>
<li>Brown: Moderately liberal affluent suburbs</li>
<li>Orange: Similar to red but not quite as poor or as Democratic</li>
</ol>


<p>Note only election results went into defining the clusters, no demographic information was used to create the clusters. Despite that, the clusters are neatly separated by demographics. Each dot color corresponds to the color in the map. Several scatterplots showing how the different state grouping relate to election results are shown in the below links. More will be added as I go through the results</p>
