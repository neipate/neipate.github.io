<p>I read a short </a> <a href="https://neipate.github.io/portland_lightrail.html"> article </a> on Denver's light rail with a visualization of how many live in walking distance to its rail station. It showed there were few residents living in in walking distance of many in-city rail stops. To compare, I calculated how many live near each Portland light rail station and made a map shown below. As calculating walking distance along actual roads would be challenging, I estimated walking distance by  </a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry">Taxicab distance</a>, the absolute sum of the north-south and east-west distance (most accurate for a tight gridded city). The stop colors correspond to the line color, when a stop is served by multiple lines I colored the stop by the longest line. Click on the stop for the population living within 1/2 mile of the stop.  </p>

<p>About 10% of the three-county region lives within 1/2 mile to a light rail stop or 164,000 in total, just Portland city would have a higher percentage. In comparison, from the above link only 8% of Denver city residents are in a 1/2 mile walk to a light rail stop. The walking distance population increases greatly with a more generous distance thershold; 292,000 live within 3/4 miles of a light rail stop.</p>
