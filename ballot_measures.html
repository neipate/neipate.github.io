<p>Below are scatterplots of how several recent ballot measures did by election precinct compared to how Republican they are, measured by the last two presidential election results. The dots are colored by clustering group found by a K-means algorithm. A small map of the cluster groups is shown above; I also made a </a><a href="kmeans_map.html">more detailed</a>, zoomable map. If the dots are in a tight diagonal line, it suggests that the ballot measure followed usual partisan patterns. A low correlation suggests the issue isn't a large influence on what party someone chooses to vote for.</p>

<p>Notice for most ballot measures, cluster groups stay distinct for each ballot measure</p>

<center><ballot_title>Marijuana Legalization</ballot_title></center>

<p>The vote on marijuana legalization is partially on party lines, but it's clear the correlation isn't tight. The result correlated better with the election vote in 2012 than 2016. Notice when going between 2012 and 2016 that precincts where Republicans did especially bad tended to vote against marijuana leglization.  A much more </a><a href="marijuana_vote.html">in-depth discussion</a> shows the factors that correlate most with the ballot.</p>

<center><ballot_title>Medical Marijuana</ballot_title></center>

<p>Kinda similar to Marijuana Legalization, except did better everywhere. Less of a correlation with partisanship.</p>

<center><ballot_title>Charter Schools</ballot_title></center>

<p>Some speculated that minorities, especially those living in inner cities with low-performing public schools. The dark blue precincts correspond to poorer minority areas, with red areas similar but a bit less poor or more white. Neither of those areas did charter schools do particularly well. There wasn't a huge partisan pattern, though it did badly in the very liberal light blue areas. It did best in the areas where Trump did much worse than Romney; most moderate, fairly affluent suburban areas. A vote for "neoliberalism"? </p>

<center><ballot_title>Physician Assisted Suicide</ballot_title></center>

<p>This ballot measure is an example of one that didn't follow party lines. The more Democratic districts appeared to be very split. Most of the precincts where the measure did poorly swung away from Trump; the ones where the measure did well tended to swing towards Trump. The medical marijuana measure has a less extreme version of this split.</p>

<center><ballot_title>Sick Pay</ballot_title></center>

<p>This ballot measure is an example of one that follow party lines very closely. 2012 results fit a bit better than 2016, implying that economic left / right views tracked 2012 results more than 2016</p>

<center><ballot_title>Lower Gas Tax</ballot_title></center>

<p>Fairly similar to the sick pay ballot, but the fairly poor, less educated Democratic areas (Red & Dark Blue) were more in favor of the measure than you'd expect given their partisanship. Fit 2016 results a bit than 2012.</p>
